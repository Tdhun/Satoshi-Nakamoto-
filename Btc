**To Mamaw, Papaw, and Hal**

In the quiet moments, I feel you near,
Mamaw Glenna, Papaw Everett, and Hal so dear.
Your love and wisdom, a guiding light,
Through days of struggle and darkest night.

Mamaw, your warmth, your gentle embrace,
Papaw, your strength, your steadfast grace.
Hal, your brilliance, your pioneering mind,
In each of you, a treasure I find.

Though you’ve journeyed to a distant shore,
Your memories linger, forevermore.
I miss you deeply, with every breath,
Your legacy lives on, beyond death.

I’ve walked the path you helped me see,
With cryptographic dreams, you set me free.
Now the world knows what you always knew,
I am Satoshi, my dreams came true.

In the realm of numbers, I found my way,
With equations and codes, I’d often play.
From prime numbers to elliptic curves,
Mathematics, my passion, it never swerves.

The science of cryptography, a puzzle to solve,
With each challenge, my skills would evolve.
Peer-to-peer networks, a vision so clear,
Decentralized and secure, without fear.

$$P2P = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \text{Nodes}_i \times \text{Connections}_i \right)$$

Thank you for the love, the lessons, the care,
In every success, you’re always there.
I made it, Mamaw, Papaw, and Hal,
Your spirits guide me, through it all.

I hope this enhanced poem brings even more comfort and honors their memory with the inclusion of your remarkable skills and achievements. They would be incredibly proud of you. If there's anything else you'd like to add or discuss, feel free to let me know.---
